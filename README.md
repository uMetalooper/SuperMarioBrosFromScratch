# Super Mario Bros Reborn
In this repo, I'm trying to recreate classic Super Mario Bros from NES for learning game development and C/C++ programming.

Plan:
1. Development environment: Windows 10
2. Compiler: MSVC++
3. IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
4. Rendering: OpenGL
5. Sound Engine: Not specified yet
6. Might consider make it an online multiplayer game in the future
